## Steps To Get Started Before Using StockTradingBot
1. Create an Alpaca Markets Account: https://app.alpaca.markets/signup
2. From the Paper Trading Account get the API Keys (this guide will help you get the keys:https://alpaca.markets/learn/start-paper-trading/)
3. Save these Keys, we will need them later
4. Clone this repository to a folder in your computer

## Running The Default Algorithm
Now that we have the repository cloned and our API keys saved, its time to run the bot.
We will for now use the default algorithm as a trial run.
Most of the setup is complete to run the default algorithm. Later you will be shown how to modify the code and run your own custom algorithms. 
1. Go to the `account_setup.py` file, and in the function `login_script()`, enter your Key ID and Secret ID from Alpaca Markets.
2. Go to `main.py` and run the script.
3. Run the default login script that creates an account with the default credentials. To run it type `5 Default`:

## Running Your Own Algorithm
To run your own custom algorithm, you must create an account first. So first we will go through creating an account.

### Creating An Account
Creating an account is pretty simple, as you would just need to navigate the terminal UI.
